Back in 2015, I bought a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4". Since then, it's been my go to device for everything. I have probably used it for thousands of hours, so choosing a successor is important to me.

I still find it difficult to take that Android lacks Faster Than Light and the (Slightly Watered Down) Democracy 3 game. For these reasons, I need my device to be IOS.

I'm sure very few of us played all characters' original games. Like me, I believe many of you wanted to know at least a little bit about every character's story. I searched countless times about every character's story, but with a few exceptions, all I could find about most of them was really long videos and texts. But since we have a lot of characters, reading/watching all of those would take days. I believe most of us would really like a brief summary of each character's story.

He's gradually gotten into "free" games on the iPad that are driven heavily by ads and in-app purchases - but since I've disabled IAP, they're horribly slow and repetitive.

I'm interested in finding more traditional gaming experiences for my iPad Pro. I have a Steelseries Nimbus controller and the smart keyboard, and I'd like to make use of one or both in a game. What I don't like is in-app purchases, "f2p" models that lock progress behind premium items or time locks, or overly simple gameplay. A lot of PC games I enjoy are RPG games such as Fallout, Witcher, Dragon's Dogma, Elder Scrolls, and Dragon Age.

TLDR: I have no idea what I'm doing, and I'm not sure if Baldur's Gate is for me. Somewhere back around 2002-2004 a friend of mine was big into Heroes of Might and Magic, and because of him I was introduced to (and hooked on) HoMaM III and IV, as well as other stuff like Age of Empires (all on PC) and he also got me into the Dynasty Warriors series (on PS2). He also played a lot of Might and Magic, but I was less into it. We both also enjoy various board games like the Game of Thron.
